    <h1>Flexjson Change Log</h1>
    <h2>Version 1.3</h2>
    <h3>June 24, 2007</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Enhancements
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Added support for wildcarding fields (*.class).  This allows you to include and exclude fields
                    through wildcards.  Wildcarding is not used to serialize deeper in the graph.  The only way to
                    serialize deeply is by explicitly naming a path like( foo.bar.baz ), or using deeplySerialize().
                    Wildcard simply act off the portion of the output specified in the other fields. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Added prettyPrint() method so that output can be pretty printed for development.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Bug Fixes
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Strings containing '/' characters were being escaped unnecessarily.  Removed the escaping of '/' in
                    strings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Removed unnecessary whitespace from the output from serialize() saving about 5% of the size.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When cycles were encountered in the object graph Flexjson could output bad json particularly with
                    collections.  Usually this ment an extra comma was added when it shouldn't be.  Now for maps,
                    arrays, properties of objects, and other collections it will first check to see if any output was
                    created before putting the comma in the output.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Declared fields in base classes weren't being serialized.  Now Flexjson will traverse up the
                    heirarchy and serialize any public non-static, non-transient field it encounters.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Documentation was incorrect about serializing many-to-one and one-to-one relationships.  They are
                    automatically serialized by default.  If you don't want many-to-one or one-to-one relationships
                    serialized use the exclude() method to omit them.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Version 1.2</h2>
    <h3>May 22, 2007</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Enhancements
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Added deepSerialize method to serialize a Java object recursively.  Includes, excludes, and
                    annotations are honored.  However, using includes really only matters if you are overiding
                    an annotation that is excluding a field by default.  Cycles in the graph are ignored.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Bug Fixes
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Made Flexjson output conform to JSON standard.  The serialization of dates is not standardized by
                    the JSON spec.  However, you cannot use the new keyword in the JSON output according to the spec.
                    So the JSON Flexjson was emitting in the previous was not JSON compliant because it would write out
                    <code>new Date( ... )</code>.  It has been changed to send the time as the number of milliseconds
                    since midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cycles in the graph produced a StackOverflowException.  Objects that had circular references
                    would produce StackOverflowException.  While you could workaround this issue using excludes or
                    annotations the code was now fixed to prevent the stack overflows by default and not serialize
                    cycles.  Any cycle in the graph will be ignored.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
