    <h1>Flexjson Change Log</h1>
    <h2>Version 1.2</h2>
    <h3>May 22, 2007</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Enhancements
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Added deepSerialize method to serialize a Java object recursively.  Includes, excludes, and
                    annotations are honored.  However, using includes really only matters if you are overiding
                    an annotation that is excluding a field by default.  Cycles in the graph are ignored.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Bug Fixes
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Made Flexjson output conform to JSON standard.  The serialization of dates is not standardized by
                    the JSON spec.  However, you cannot use the new keyword in the JSON output according to the spec.
                    So the JSON Flexjson was emitting in the previous was not JSON compliant because it would write out
                    <code>new Date( ... )</code>.  It has been changed to send the time as the number of milliseconds
                    since midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cycles in the graph produced a StackOverflowException.  Objects that had circular references
                    would produce StackOverflowException.  While you could workaround this issue using excludes or
                    annotations the code was now fixed to prevent the stack overflows by default and not serialize
                    cycles.  Any cycle in the graph will be ignored.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
